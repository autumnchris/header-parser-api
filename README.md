# Header Parser API

An Express.js API that gets the user's current IP address, set language, and operating system.

Inspired by the [Request Header Parser Microservice challenge](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/request-header-parser-microservice) as part of the curriculum for the [Back End Development and APIs Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis) on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).
